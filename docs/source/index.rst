Welcome to Bathy-Vagues's documentation!
========================================

Context
-------
This project was made in the context of the "Projet Long" at ENSEEIHT Toulouse
during February 2019. In team of 5, we tackled a machine learning open research
problem coming from a client needs and tried to propose a solution. We were
supervised and evaluated by an industrial actor from Altran (Toulouse) on our
professionalism and our ability to work and lead a team project. We are proud
to share with you our work and its results in this little internet webpage
document.

Description
-----------
Nowday, litoral regions are facing major environmental issues coming from 
demographic pressures and overexploitation, it is both dangerous for the sea
nature maintenance and the population living there, experimenting in some areas
extreme wheather events as flood and erosion. For all these reasons we are 
interested in this work to improve the wave dynamic representation with non
invasive and cheap data such as satellite images. We hope, by leaning on a 
timestack representation of the waves, to succeed to show the interest of
machine learning as a potential and maybe good solution to predict the 
bathymetry of the beach.
