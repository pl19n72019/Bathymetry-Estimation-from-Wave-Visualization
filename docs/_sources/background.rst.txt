Theory and Background
=====================

Bathymetry estimation is not a new problem. Actually, there are already few solutions to approximate the sea floor. Many of them are based on what we call a DIA (Depth Inversion Algorithms). This article :cite:`DIA` summarize few of them. Such an algorithm is based on the inversion of a dispersion relationship between the celerity and the depth.

.. math::
	
	\Omega (\underline{k}) = \sqrt{gk\tanh(kh_r)} \mbox{ avec } k = \|\underline{k}\|
